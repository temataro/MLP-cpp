# MLP-cpp

Implement a [multilayer preceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) with C++.

Start with a horribly unoptimized, working prototype and explore performance
gains through actual study and best practices. (Expand to profiling CUDA
kernels once impl gets mature enough.)
